## About me in 10 minutes

Hi, my name is Parav Singla, and I'm a nobody. 

Reading about who I am or what I do is probably not going to solve any major problems in your life, but since you're here and it looks like you have some time on your hands, I'd like to tell you a story.


The year was 2012, and rumor had it that the world was going to end. But somewhere in a little corner of the world, a curious little kid with starry brown eyes had just gotten his first mobile device - a Nokia 5233. And while people were busy making speculations about the apocalypse, this little kid had just found the key to another world- the digital one.

And so, the journey that began with me deploying a wordpress website to a free shared hosting service has led me through doors I never imagined existed. Over the years, I've built at least a couple dozen websites and webapps using php, Rails, Node.js and Django.

And some of them have been for my own ventures. I caught the startup bug in university and like to call myself an entrepreneur. Though you could argue that I'm just a small business owner, but 'entrepreneur' has a nice ring to it. And besides, it's what the cool kids call themselves these days, and I'll have you know that I'm anything but not-cool.

Expression is huge for me, and whether its through my writing, my music, or my poetry, I like to indulge in it for a significant amount of time during my day. I won't say if I'm any good though, because I don't really care either way. But I haven't been escorted out of any of the open mics I've been to, yet.

And I doubt it will happen, because I believe in improving myself every single day. Continuous learning, continous evaluation and continuous recalibration - thats my motto. I like to learn at a fast pace. Thats why I like to teach myself and prefer written material over audio and visual media. 

But don't think I'm some kind of speed demon. I'm a pretty low energy and chill kind of guy. It's really difficult to get me excited about something. I don't commit to things very often, but the things that I do take up, I like to see them through. It's either a 'Hell, Yes' for me or a 'No'.


### I write for myself

This may come across as a bit self indulgent but when I write, I'm mostly talking to myself. I like to pretend no one will ever read this stuff (which is probably true). If I think too much about people reading my stuff, I tend to censor my thoughts and the whole thing ends up being insincere.

I realised long ago that I like reading what I write. It captures a time, place and emotion for me which I like to relive often. 


### Music

I have a very broad taste in music. I love Indian Classical Music, especially the Light Classical forms Ghazal, Thumri and Qawwalli. I also love listening to sufi, soft rock, hip hop, and punjabi folk. I don't like EDM. Some of my favorite artists are Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Ustad Ghulam Ali Khan, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Javed Bashir, Jeff Buckley, Daughtry, Nikhil D'souza, Eminem and Bohemia.



### I hate noise

I love silence and solitude. Crowds drain me. I find it difficult to converse with multiple people at the same time, so most of my interactions are one-on-one, and to the point. I believe that there's too much noise in the world as is so I refrain from contributing to it. You'll find that I either express my thoughts honestly or stay silent.
My idea of fun is reading a thought provoking book, or discovering a piece of music that I would listen to a million times and still not get bored. 


### There you go 
You know me a lot better now. So don't be shy, and [say hello](/contact) to return the favour. I'd love to know about you.
