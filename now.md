## What I'm doing now

### Work:

I'm a Software Engineer intern in a finance/tech company where I work on a Python/Django based microservice application. The internship will last till the mid of December, after which, I have to go back to college and complete a last semester.

### Placements:

I am preparing for campus placements which start at the end of December. I'll be aiming for a Software Engineer role. So I need to learn a lot, my major being ECE and not CS.

### Freelancing:

I've stopped taking freelance projects for a while save for some minor work because between the internship and interview preparation, there's very little time left for other things.

### That's All

These are all the things that I'm working on in the moment. I've said halted my work on my music, startups and writing. This is a critical phase in my life which is going to decide a lot of stuff in my future. So, these are the decisions that I've taken after careful considerations.
