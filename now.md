## What I'm doing now

### Work:

I did an internship in a finance/tech company where I worked on a Python/Django based microservice application. The internship lasted till the mid of December, after which, I was extended an offer to join as a full time employee, which I think was very kind of them.

### College:

I have one semester of college remaining where I have some course work and a thesis to do. I expect the workload to be fairly light so I'll be participating in my other usual stuff.

### Freelancing:

I've started taking freelance projects again now. I'm currently building a niche ecommerce store for a company.

### Music:

I've written a few songs and I'm in the process of recording them. I'll be putting them out soon.
