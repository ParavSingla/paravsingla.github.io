## What I'm doing now

### Work:

I am an Associate Software Engineer at a very large association which creates, among other things, processors for mobile devices.

### College:

I graduated this year. (Yay!)

### Freelancing:

I've started taking freelance projects again now. I'm currently building an LMS for a company.

### Music:

I've written a few songs and I'm in the process of recording them. I'll be putting them out soon.
