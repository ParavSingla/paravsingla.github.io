<article class="post-content">
  <p>I recently said goodbye to an old friend.</p>

<p>This friend of mine, he was an odd guy. Never spoke much, didn’t have a lot of friends. Wasn’t popular. Wasn’t one of the cool kids. There was one thing he had going for him though - he was brilliant. One of the smartest guys I’ve ever seen, but he was tossed aside. Like those really cheap disposable pens you’re never happy you bought in the first place. You buy them because they’re cheap, and you don’t care if you lose them.</p>

<p>I got to know him in school. I think I was his first friend. He always paid attention in class, and he would ask these amazingly insightful questions. You could practically see the teacher’s eyes light up when he raised his hand. But I guess people hated that. People hated that there was someone smarter than them. They hated that the teacher would walk all the way to the last bench to have a conversation with him, ignoring all the first benchers who were supposed to be the smart ones. He would’ve liked to sit at the first bench too, but the backbenchers were a lot more accepting.</p>

<p>He was always rejected. Made fun of. I remember he never brought lunch. Maybe he didn’t want to eat alone. I remember him sitting at the corner - looking out of the window. There were days when he was really popular though - usually when the exams were near. You could see the first benchers chatting him up, trying to figure out the secrets of his brilliance. Those were the only days I would see him smile. But I think he knew. He knew that they would disappear after the exams. I guess he was just enjoying it while it lasted.</p>

<p>It was the worst for him when a new year started. New people would join the class and after a couple of days, they would all settle down and find their groups, except him. He would sit with the firstbenchers for a couple of days, then they would toss him to the back. Sometimes, he would find another guy who no one wanted either and they would sit together. On other occasions, I would find him alone, always at the last bench, his chair slightly angled to the left.</p>

<p>During middle school, he was really fat. People would call him all sorts of names, make fun of him for being slow, physically, of course, but he took it all without a reaction. I never once saw him complain. It always broke my heart, seeing a nice guy being picked on. I used to wonder why life is so cruel to people sometimes, people who are good. Why is it always the smart guys and the nice guys who have a hard time in life.</p>

<p>After school, they spend their twenties building their life, while the people who make fun of them have nothing to build. And then in their thirties, after being alone for so many years, they marry the first girl that shows them any affection. Of course, with their juvenile understanding of relationships, they spend all their time working hard to please the girl, never realising that no amount of work, no amount of negotiation will make their girl want to love them.</p>

<p>But this guy didn’t even get a chance to see that. After school, he made it into one of the most prestigious institutions in the country. No one in my town came even close to what he achieved, except for a couple of girls, but their accomplishments are by association to the people they married. This guy, who was treated as a third class citizen his whole life, all the popular kids did nothing compared to him. I was happy for him. I thought he would finally get a chance to be near people like him.</p>

<p>I guess I was wrong.</p>

<p>They say he hung himself in his room. All I have now is his smile and his hauntingly beautiful questions. They can go on and on about how the education system is broken, but the education system never failed him. He had perfect grades, even in college.</p>

<p>People failed him.</p>

<p>People like me, who would never have what he had.</p>
