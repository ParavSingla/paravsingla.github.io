                    <p>It was October of 2014.</p>

<p>I was in my first year in the university. Me and my friends were carrying this really heavy robot(if you could call it that) that we had created for competing in a competition called Robowars.</p>

<p>We were spent - both mentally and physically. It was not the transportation of that chunk of metal that had exhausted us. We had just been through the first round of the competition. And I couldn’t believe that we’d won. I couldn’t will my legs to stop shaking.</p>

<p>We stopped in the middle of road that led to the hostels to catch our breath. I was barely functional. This was the most exhilarating experience I had ever had in my life. I was trying to calm myself down. It felt like my heart would explode. I was overcome by a plethora of emotions. We had just started this for fun. My friend, who was to control the bot, only had a couple of hours of practice.</p>

<p>I was a kid who came from a town with a population of 50,000. In India, that makes for a very small town. My high school class had a strength of 40. I made it to state level in sports and ten people knew about it. My facebook profile picture had 9 likes on it, and that was back when facebook was the cool thing.</p>

<p>And Bam! a couple months later, the same kid whom nobody had given a shit about his whole life was standing in an arena surrounded by at least a couple hundred people, all chanting the name of his team. Why wouldn’t it be the most exhilarating experience of his life.</p>

<p>We were setting up the bot, doing a precursory check. Our opponents were final year students. They were calm. It looked like they meant business. It was then I noticed that he hadn’t anticipated this crowd too. He was shaking more than me. I offered to control the bot. He hesitantly handed me the controller. I used the same trick to calm myself down that I use everytime. “None of this will matter in a few years”, I told to myself. “Nobody will remember how bad you sucked.”</p>

<p>But its hard to convince yourself that when there are hundreds of people chanting the name of your team and your college. Home crowd ‘advantage’. I mess up even my favorite songs if I have to play them for people to this date. So no doubt, I sucked pretty bad. Regardless, we had won. And since we wouldn’t stop shouting after the match, they kicked us out of there. So there we were - in the middle of the road, our bodies shaking, and our heads still trying to process what had happened.</p>

<p>A guy approached us, asking for a picture. I looked at my friend. We thought he was from another college. We somehow managed to pose for a decent photograph. We talked for a while and then while leaving, we exchanged names. His sounded vaguely familiar, but I didn’t care.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who had seen us later told me that the guy was an alumnus, and he was somebody.</p>

<p>It is 2018 now. Almost four years have passed since the day, but I remember it like it was yesterday. At some point between now and then, I abandoned the aforementioned technique to calm myself down. Because the truth is, while nobody did remember how bad I sucked (except my friends), it has been a few years and it still matters.</p>

<p>It mattered to me then, and it matters to me now. And it matters not because I spent months working on that robot, or because it was the first time I had experienced something like it, though these are perfectly valid reasons. It matters because even though now I live in a city with a population of 12 million, the corporation I work for employs 250,000 people, and I have more than 9 likes on my facebook profile picture, I’m still that kid.</p>

<p>“This is a moment that you’ll remember for a long, long time. Let’s make the best out of it.” is what I say to myself nowadays.</p>
