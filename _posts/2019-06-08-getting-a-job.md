After a tremendous process of studying, practicing, mock interviewing and real interviewing, I got a job. 

The process taught me a lot of things. Since I earlier had a pre pracement offer, I was not eligible for campus placements and when I learned that the offer was rescinded, the placement session was mostly done. So I had to look for a job myself, like most people do. In some ways, now that I think about it, it was a liberating experience. Not knowing where I'll be or what I'll be doing. Being free, really, to choose anything.

But unfortunately, that is not how I viewed it at the time. I was scared. I think the fear came from the knowledge that most of my friends and other people that I knew in the university had a job, and I didn't. Some of it was also from the fact that my family counted on me to have a job.

It was a shitty feeling. It made me want to not interact with people. It made me want to curl up in my bed and blame someone, anyone, for me having ended up in this situation. And I had a lot of people I could blame. But, and I am still amazed at myself for this, thats not what I did. Somehow, I had this belief that I will find a job. That could have been confidence - since I had a decent profile.

But it was much more than that. It was like I could say with a 100 percent conviction that it'll be alright. And that was huge. 

There was another lesson that I learned. Friends. The people you count on during a crisis. Sometimes, a complete stranger helps you while your friends don't even lift a finger. And so, it is important to ask for help. I didn't. At first. But when I did, I was glad I did. There are good people in this world who go out of their way to help you and don't even expect a 'thank you'. 

Small acts of kindness really make a difference.
