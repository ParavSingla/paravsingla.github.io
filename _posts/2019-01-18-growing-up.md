Coming back after the intership to college has made me see the college in a whole different light. It literally feels like a different place. Funny thing is, the college has not changed one bit, well, except for the fact that I don't see a lot of familiar faces. Its me who has changed. I go to classes now. I never thought I'd be that guy. 

This makes me think about how I have changed over the time I've spent in college. It is, I think easy to say the generic statement that I've grown a lot, but its a lot harder to back it up. There was this old man who was once rambling on and on about how the ancient Indian system of Gurukuls was the shit, and we should bring it back. "Those places made boys into men", he said. "Girls grow up to be women automatically, boys need to be made into men". His words sounded nice to me. Sure enough, I found out later that in almost every culture, there used to be a ceremony of sort, where a boy was declared a man after some test or a ritual was performed.

So I decided before coming here that I would treat this place as my gurukul. I will learn how to be self sufficient and devour all that the place has to offer. And I would say that I have utterly failed in preserving that sentiment. Now, in my 11th and 12th grades, I had forced myself to be a really high energy guy in pursuit of the opposite sex. I was in a long distance "relationship" during my first and second year, which had a huge, huge impact on my college life. My social growth was stunted. Breaking up was difficult, which then lead to me almost destroying myself by binge eating fast foods, binge watching tv shows, commiting to a shit load of things and delivering nothing. The high energy guy turned into a lazy slob. I think watching TV shows was the single biggest waste of my time.

At this point, you might say that I didn't really learn anything during the time, but that would be incorrect. There were times when for a couple of weeks, I would be really excited about something and I would devour every piece of information about the topic and I would work like crazy. But that motivation would only last for a few days. At one point , I even thought I was bipolar or something. 

One good thing I have done is that I have read a lot. Books and music. Only two things in my life have been consistent. Sometimes when I read something, I'm really moved by an idea, but I'm unable to apply it immediately in my life and I forget about it. But my brain stores that idea somewhere. At a later point in time, something happens which triggers that idea and all of a sudden, something clicks in my brain. Its like a switch being turned on. And lo, there I am, applying that idea in real life.

During the college life, there is a very, very high number of those clicks that have happened to me. The way I talk, the way I think, and the way I perceive things has completely changed because of that. And although I have a lot to say against TV shows, they have made me a lot more, uh, sophisticated, if you will. I can now express myself much more eloquently in the English language.

And then there is the work ethic that I learned during the internship, which, in my opinion, is the single most desirable quality in an individual, especially since most people of my generation seem to be lacking in that department due to us being accustomed to instant gratification.

Keeping these thoughts in mind, I believe I would not be wrong to say that I have really grown up during this time. I now have a much better idea of what kind of man I really want to be and am well on my way to realise that goal.
