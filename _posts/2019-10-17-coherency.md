I maintain a journal. Yesterday, I was reading some of my very old entries and they were absolutely nonsense. I couldn't make any sense of the word salad that I had written. That is, until I remembered what I was thinking at the time.

I realized something - I'm not really a coherent type of person. There's just too much going on in my head for me to be focused on one thing. Even when I'm coding, I'm almost always parallelly working on multiple files. And I always need to collect my thoughts before I speak. Even when I'm making a casual conversation, my mind just wanders off to random places.

And I don't write coherent articles. My writings always start someplace and end somewhere entirely different. Its okay. They are not pieces of academic literature. People's lives don't depend on my words. I have the liberty to express myself as I deem fit.

Then I realized how crazy would I sound if I said everything I think out loud. It's a good thing I'm not much of a talker. 

A lot of time it happens, that we just pay attention to the words coming out of the mouth of a person. We rarely think what the person was thinking at the time they said those words. But once you try to understand, there's so much more you get from the words. Think about the times you had a really great conversation with someone. The times it seemed like you guys really connected, or the other person really understood what you were trying to say. You got the feeling that words weren't really necessary.

More often than not, these types of conversations happen when we try to go beyond the face value of the words.

A good conversationalist, I think,  not only communicates what he wants to say in unequivocal terms, but he also extracts more from what he receives.

Ironically, this article about coherency is incoherent.
