I recently built my first hackintosh. 

A hackintosh is a computer running mac os on non apple hardware. As you can imagine, its a long and involved process. I came across a couple of challenges on the way, but was able to do it with some help from the popular hackintosh forums on the internet. But running MacOs was not what I was excited about. It was the hardware. The brand spanking new hardware.

The thing is a beast. Intel i7 8700k with liquid cooling, 32 gigs of DDR4 memory and a 24 inch (almost) bezel less display. Putting it together was a blast. Initially, I wanted to build a custom case. I wanted to make it portable. I talked to my friend who has more knowledge than me in the field and we discussed designs for days.

But we realised soon enough that we were way in over our heads and building a decent, robust case would take months, time which none of us had. So I started looking into small form factor cases on the market and there were very few of them available in India, and I had destroyed my chances with all of them by using liquid cooling. 

I had two options - ditch the liquid cooler and buy a small air cooler or use a larger case. As I often do when I have a tough decision to make, I decided to do nothing for a couple of days. Almost magically, I found that a case from a chinese company that I had overlooked because it was large, had its dimensions provided incorrectly on the website. I knew I would have to make some modifications but this was still better than the other options.

Now, the case was small, but fitting liquid cooling was very challenging, to say the least. It took me a whole day to cram the hardware inside. I had to take out almost everything that could be taken out from the case. But I am happy with the results. The CPU core temperature didn't cross 50 degrees under heavy load, despite very low clearance between the radiator fans and the case. 

The whole process of putting it together took me back to the childhood days. Back then, I was a god among men - atleast to my friends. I was the guy everyone called when they had a technical problem. I was Mr. Fixit. And I loved doing that. I had a bag full of CDs - games, software, operating systems - you name it. I installed Ubuntu 7.1 on my pc when I was in 10th grade, when the guy who lived below me was paying 10k a year to a guy for his copy of pirated windows.

I built my first PC when I was in ninth grade. This experience was nothing like that. Things were much simpler back then. But I was way more excited back then. I remember how my hands wouldn't stop shaking when I was putting the ram in the motherboard. I was scared I would break something. 

I miss that kid sometimes. He would get excited by little things. He would go on and on about the new Egyptian flavor of Win XP he torrented at the speed of 50kbps.

People say to me that I'll remember college as the best time of my life. 

I have almost graduated college. Few things will ever be as close to me as the curiosity and the laughter of that kid is.
