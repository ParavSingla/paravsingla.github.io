"Why would he want me?", I asked him. I haven't even graduated yet. This is a serious affair. Teaching a class of 500 people ML and AI is no joke.
"He really likes your profile."

"What profile?"

My profile was that I was available. And he needed someone to fill the spot ASAP. Besides, I had nothing to lose. It would be a new experience, and it as decent money.
The first workshop was in Vishakhapatnam. And it was around 200 people, not 500. Still a large number though. The ten days that I took two three hour sessions a day transformed my life.
I didn't know I was capable of that. It was gruelling, it was tiresome, it was trying on my soul, but it was fucking amazing.
After the first two days, I couldn't recognize my voice and my whole body ached. In the evening, I would come back to my hotel room and think about what I was doing. I wanted to nope the fuck out of there.
