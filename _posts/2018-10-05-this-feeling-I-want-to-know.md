The feeling of wanting something bad.

There's this feeling I really want to know. I have been longing for it for a long time now. And I have searched hard for something that will cause me to experience that feeling. Just once. Just for a few moments. 

I want to feel desperation. I want to experience it with every fiber of my being. In Eric Thomas' words, I want to want something as bad as I want to breathe. I want to want something so bad that it hurts not to have it. At this point, I'm basically frustrated that I don't get to have it. 

Every night, I sleep with this longing in my heart and this hope that I will find something that will make me do things I would never imagine doing and every morning before I'm fully awake I'm reminded of this emptiness. I like to imagine how it would feel to go all out, and then go all out some more.

Now, as with most things, I have had a comprehensive discussion with myself about this idea since I first started toying with it. I tried to get out of it. I told myself that maybe no such thing really exists, maybe this is romanticized by writers to the point that they make you want it. Maybe I don't really want it. But I couldn't convince myself.

What really bothers me, though, is that this goes against my entire life philosophy. I'm the most interesting boring person I have ever met. I just chill. Thats it. I don't get excited, I don't get angry, I don't get frustrated. I just chill. And I have consciously worked on it. Now, chilling is something I automatically do. And I definitely don't get desperate. I'm always willing to walk away - to a fault.

But its not like I haven't tried. I have tried countless times to pursue something that excites me, and I have made progress. There are things that I care very deeply about. But I just can't seem to care enought.

I think Charles Bukowski described it the best in Factotum:

> “If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.”
