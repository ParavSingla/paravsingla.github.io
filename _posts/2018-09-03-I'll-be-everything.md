It was not too long ago that I realized something - Life is long.

Now, it was a very odd realization. I tried to fight it. Maybe it seems long because you don't have anything to do, I said to myself. But it was not true. I barely have time to think these days.

And most people complain about that too. Not having enough time. There is nothing in the world I hate more than my need to sleep. And it seems to me that a lot of people feel the same. That is why almost every motivational quote emphasizes the importance of time. Life is too short, they say.

I'm 22 right now. I hope I live at least 40 more years. That is twice the time I've lived. There's a scary thought - I've lived through one third of my life, and that is if I'm lucky.

But then I think about these 22 years - all the things I've learnt, the fun I've had, the memories I've made. And I can do two times more the stuff I've done. Possibly more, if I spend my time wisely.

'Life is short' - I think it all comes down to how you interpret these words. If you take them at face value, it means there are only are few things that you'll get to do. So pick wisely. And from what I've seen, there are two choices - pick one or two things, get really good at them, and maybe if you religiously devote your life to those, you'll achieve something magical, and hope that the world recognizes that magic, preferably while you are alive.

Now, some really brilliant people have managed to create magic in more than a couple of fields. And I think that's something really rare, and not really whithin the reach of most people.

But the gold standard, what society tells you, is that you pick a field - ideally something you are "passionate" about - and get so good that people pay you to practice it. The earlier in your life you start, the better. And that becomes your living. And maybe then, you have some chance of creating some magic.

Then you take care of other people - your family, and hope that your children will also follow your way of life. And that becomes the dream for most people (including me, until a little while ago). And there is nothing wrong with that, if you are the kind of person who can devote his life to a single thing.

But I'm not. And I used to beat myself up for it. People who cared about me would be frustrated, and furious that I can't seem to be able to stick to a thing. And that used to make me frustrated and sad. If I continue like this, I'll never be able to make it to the gold standard. What will I do with my life? I've tried hard to answer this question but to no avail.

But there's a second choice, and a second, slightly different interpretation of the words 'Life is short'. For me these words mean that if you don't actively participate in your own life, it will seem short to you. That means you have to be more than just the observer. You have to be at the cause. You have to stop other people from controlling your life. And its difficult. It is difficult to stop letting other people dictate your life because you are too used to it. I was too used to it.

So the first thing I did was to stop putting the blame on others. Even if it actually was their fault, I would take the blame on myself. That empowered me. If you blame other people, you can't solve the problem, because you take the power out of your hands. And that also helped me to take better decisions. Because I knew that I would later blame myself if anything goes wrong, I took the responsibility to do things I wanted.

It sounds selfish, and it is. Because the most important person for me, is me.

And now, all of a sudden, life seems long to me. Because I actively participate in it. I want to do a lot of things. I want to be a lot of things. It used to make me sad because I thought I won't be able to. But now, I've come to know that if I'm willing to let go of the gold standard, to let go of the possibility of creating magic, I get to ask the question: why not all?

Why can't I be everything I want and more? The old answer was "life is short". But I think its the mindset that is short. And I used to operate in the short-term mindset. But now, when I dream about me being something new, I collect everything and push it to a folder.

I'll pick it up later.

I'll be everything, just not at the same time.
